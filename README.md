# Cycle_Detection
Dection of cycles in directed graphs using Python and adjacency matrices.

Input:
List of adjacency matrcices (prefaced with the graph order) of simple directed graphs (no loops or multiple edges).

Methodology:
Using a Depth First Search implementation to detect back arcs to conclude whether the graph has a (directed) cycle or not.

Output:
Statement whether the graph is a DAG (directed acyclic graph) or not.
